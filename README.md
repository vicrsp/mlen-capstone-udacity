## Source code

All the python scripts are located at the `Source` folder. Jupyter notebooks are in the `Notebooks` folder.

### Scripts

* `main.py`: this script will read the `train.parquet` file and apply all the signal processing steps. It should be the first file to be executed and will generate the `all_features.csv` file in the `Outputs` folder.
* `feature_extraction.py`: this file contains the feature extraction routines
* `signal_denoising.py`: this file contains the PD denoising routines 
* `dashboard.py`: contains a simple application written in [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) to visualize the relationships in `all_features.csv` file. 

### Notebooks

* `data_exploration_notebook`: this notebook contains was used to generate the visualizations in the report
* `data_processing_and_modelling`: this notebook loads the `all_features.csv` file, applies the pre processing steps described in the report and execute the machine learning algorithms

Summarizing:
1. Execute `main.py` to process the .parque data
2. Execute the `data_processing_and_modelling` notebook to pre-process the data and learn the models.

## Data

The data can be downloaded at:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/vsb-power-line-fault-detection/data

Only the `metadata_train.csv` and `train.parquet` files are required for this project. They must be placed in the `Input` folder. Output data generated by the scripts is located in the `Output` folder.

## Environment Configuration

* Python version used for the project development: 3.6.6
* The [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/install.html) package is necessary to read the .parquet files.
* The [pywt](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) package is necessary to perform the DWT denoising procedures.
* Other required packages: scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn
* [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) and [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/) are only required to run the `dashboard.py` file
